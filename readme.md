###It adds download links to eDimension whattttttt

If you like this, check check out some other stuff I did for eDimension
- [eDimensionReverser](https://github.com/glencbz/edimensionReverser) Changes the order of the course page and highlights your current courses
-[eDimensionWeekMover](https://github.com/glencbz/eDimensionWeekMover) Copies the current week's materials to the top and highlights it in a different colour

**Works best in Chrome**
###Essentials
- Creates links from bottom to top (I assume you're probably downloading the latest stuff)
- Tends to lag on a slow Internet (sorry)
- Links don't always work immediately (but there's a neat little progress bar that tells you when everything will be ok!)
