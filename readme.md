###It adds download links to eDimension whattttttt

In all seriousness, this is a pretty hacky script. It works well enough for me, but I suggest that you don't get your hopes up too high. I've tried my best to work around eDimension, but I can only manage so much.

**Works best in Chrome**
###Essentials
- Creates links from bottom to top (I assume you're probably downloading the latest stuff)
- Tends to lag on a slow Internet (sorry)
- Links don't always work immediately (but there's a neat little progress bar that tells you when everything will be ok!)

###Requires

- [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox 
- [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Chrome

###Download
